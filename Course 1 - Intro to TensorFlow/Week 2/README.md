### An Introduction to Computer Vision

- Computer vision is a field in Computer Science which basically is having a computer understand and label what is present in an image.
- The dataset used here is the Fashion MNIST which has 70k images in 10 different categories, of the size 28x28.
- The images are sufficient enough that the neural network can distinguish the features but gets results faster due to the smaller size of the images.
- The images are also grayscale so that each pixel can be represented in a value of 0-255 i.e 1 byte per pixel therefore the entire image is 784 bytes in size.
