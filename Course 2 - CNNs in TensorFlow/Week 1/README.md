## Week 1 - Exploring a Larger Dataset

- Continuing from the previous course, this first week focuses on working with a larger dataset i.e. Cats Vs. Dogs dataset from Kaggle.
- This dataset contains overr 25,000 images clearly labelled and separated into training and validation sets.
- For any theory references, please look at the last course.

### How to improve over the previous CNNs?

- When training the previous CNN on the newer Cats v Dogs dataset, the accuracy hovers around 75% on the validation set. This accuracy can be improved with some trial and error.
- The first trial involves cropping the images to remove extra features. Eg: Branches of a tree near the subject animal (or) human hands holding the subject animal.
